# A-Clark_LIDA_Application
A small-scale R project exploring the effects of travel and fixture congestion on NBA match outcomes, created for my LIDA Data Scientist Development Programme application - utilising a small portion of an analysis I did for my PhD. Demonstrates skills in data scraping, feature engineering, and machine learning.
